# Purpose
In this lab, I created an object 'Area' that had multiple methods to call. After creating the object, I called whatever method I needed in order to find the area of a specific shape.


## Example
 Area() area = new Area();
        double temp = area.triangle(2.0);
        assertEquals(temp, 1.73205);
